### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Jack! 

I'm a homeschooled 15 year old passionate about Web development, who has been learning web dev for over a year now. I have knowledge in Node.js, Typescript, and react. I've also dabbled in some other languages a little bit like, python, and c++. 

Other technologies I've used:

- Mongodb
- Graphql
- Next.js

Currently working on [Pictoshare](https://github.com/jdog787/pictoshare). This project has given me the chance to learn a lot about fullstack apps, and has been really fun to work on!

I'm also wanting to get an internship at [Replit](https://replit.com), but we will see ðŸ˜‚

Not much else to say really
